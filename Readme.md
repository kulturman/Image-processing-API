To launch the project, follow these steps:

npm i
npm start

Now you can open this URL: http://localhost:5000/api/images?filename=test.png&width=300&height=300, you can replace width and height with whatever values you want

If you want to test with another image you can drop it into dist/assets/full and use the above URL by replacing filename with the image name
